# Real Estate QA System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLaMA-3

## Project Overview
This project showcases a sophisticated Question Answering (QA) system tailored for the real estate domain. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the system combines document retrieval with natural language generation to provide accurate and context-rich answers. The integration of **gemma2-9b-it'** for language generation ensures that responses are not only relevant but also well-articulated, making this QA system an ideal tool for real estate inquiries.

### Key Objectives
- Implement a domain-specific RAG pipeline to deliver precise, relevant answers in the real estate context.
- Leverage advanced NLP techniques for document retrieval and language generation.
- Ensure seamless integration and performance optimization for real estate QA applications.

## Data
The QA system utilizes a dataset comprising real estate documents, FAQs, property listings, and transactional records. This comprehensive knowledge base ensures the system can address a wide range of real estate-related queries, from property details to market trends.

## How RAG Works for Real Estate QA
The RAG system combines retrieval and generation to enhance response accuracy and contextual relevance:

1. **Retrieval**:
   - A FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index is built on the real estate dataset, enabling fast and efficient retrieval of contextually relevant documents.
   - For each user query, Sentence Transformers are used to encode the query into a vector that captures its semantic meaning.
   - FAISS performs a similarity search, retrieving the most relevant documents from the indexed dataset, ensuring the system provides answers grounded in factual real estate information.

2. **Generation**:
   - **gemma2-9b-it'** is employed to generate responses based on both the user’s query and the retrieved documents. The model synthesizes the information to produce coherent, context-aware answers.
   - This two-step process ensures that responses are not only factual but also fluid and comprehensive, drawing from the most relevant sections of the real estate dataset.

## Model Architecture and Components
### 1. **Retrieval Component**
   - FAISS indexing is used for fast similarity search over the vectorized real estate knowledge base.
   - Sentence Transformers provide semantic encoding for the queries, ensuring that retrieval is based on meaning rather than mere keyword matches.

### 2. **Generative Component**
   - **gemma2-9b-it'** is integrated using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library, allowing for seamless, high-quality natural language generation conditioned on the retrieved documents.

### 3. **Pipeline Workflow**
   - **Step 1**: Query Encoding – Encode the user query into a vector representation.
   - **Step 2**: Document Retrieval – Retrieve the most contextually relevant documents from the FAISS index.
   - **Step 3**: Response Generation – Generate a detailed answer using LLaMA-3, conditioned on the retrieved documents and query.
