# Real Estate QA System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Project Overview
This project presents a robust, domain-specific Question Answering (QA) system tailored for the real estate industry. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this system is designed to accurately retrieve relevant real estate information and generate natural language responses to user queries. By combining retrieval techniques and large language models, this project demonstrates a sophisticated approach to providing accurate, context-aware answers in real estate.

### Key Objectives
- Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for domain-specific question answering.
- Utilize advanced NLP techniques for accurate information retrieval and natural language response generation.
- Optimize for speed and accuracy to provide a seamless user experience.

## Data
The dataset comprises a curated collection of real estate documents, FAQs, and property-related information, which serves as the knowledge base for the retrieval system. This ensures that the QA system can handle queries ranging from general real estate terms to specific property inquiries.

## Model Architecture and Components
### 1. **Retrieval Component**
   - The retrieval system is built using [specific tools or libraries, such as Elasticsearch, FAISS, or BM25], which are configured to index the real estate dataset and retrieve contextually relevant documents.
   - Each query is vectorized using a pre-trained embedding model, ensuring high semantic relevance during retrieval.

### 2. **Generator Component**
   - The generative model used is [specific model name, such as `facebook/rag-token-nq` or `distilbert-base-uncased`], fine-tuned to generate concise and accurate responses based on the retrieved documents.
   - This component integrates with the Hugging Face `transformers` library, enabling prompt-based text generation tailored for real estate queries.

### 3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**
   - **Step 1**: **Query Encoding** – The input query is encoded into a dense vector representation.
   - **Step 2**: **Document Retrieval** – Using the vectorized query, the most relevant real estate documents are retrieved from the indexed knowledge base.
   - **Step 3**: **Response Generation** – The generative model produces a response by conditioning on the retrieved documents and the input query.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python 3.8 or above, and install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install transformers faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
